## 💡 Risks & Mitigation

### Market Risks

**Risk:** LinkedIn or GitHub enters this space with similar features  
**Mitigation:** 
- Move fast, establish community before big players react
- Build deep integrations and unique features (salary transparency)
- Focus on superior user experience and developer-first design

**Risk:** Low adoption due to network effects (existing platforms too entrenched)  
**Mitigation:**
- Viral growth features (referrals, easy sharing)
- Provide unique value unavailable elsewhere (salary data)
- Start with niche communities, expand gradually

### Product Risks

**Risk:** Users don't want to share salary information  
**Mitigation:**
- Make salary fields optional
- Emphasize privacy controls (role-based access)
- Show value through anonymous market insights
- Build trust through security and transparency

**Risk:** Platform becomes job board clone, loses differentiation  
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on networking, not just jobs
- Encourage knowledge sharing and community
- Build features beyond job matching (mentorship, projects)

### Operational Risks

**Risk:** Scaling infrastructure costs exceed revenue  
**Mitigation:**
- Cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
- Optimize database queries and caching
- Charge for compute-heavy features (analytics)
- Monitor unit economics closely

**Risk:** Content moderation challenges (spam, inappropriate posts)  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement reporting system
- Use automated filters for spam
- Community moderation (upvotes/downvotes)
- Clear community guidelines and enforcement

### Financial Risks

**Risk:** Inability to raise funding if metrics don't meet targets  
**Mitigation:**
- Bootstrap with low operational costs
- Focus on profitability over growth if needed
- Build strong organic acquisition channels
- Demonstrate clear PMF before scaling spend
